- Mind the current project's code style and conventions, and ensure that the code is well-structured and maintainable.
- Follow the project's naming conventions for variables, functions, and components and mind the project's linting rules.
- Keep the useEffect hook use to minimum.
- Use functional components and coding style.
- Use global context state for managing global state instead of local state. Only use local state for functional component UI states.
- Abstract complex logic into custom hooks or utility functions to keep components clean and focused.
- Don't use inline styles; use CSS classes instead.
- Use modern CSS features like nested selectors, variables, and media queries and layers.
- Don't use CSS modules or styled-components; use a single global CSS entrypoint with imported CSS files.
- Write functional CSS that is reusable and maintainable. Define common styles directly to tag selectors instead of using classes when possible.
  - button, input, textarea, select, a, img, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, ul, li, ol, table, tr, td, th, form, fieldset, label, field, legend etc. should have common styles defined in the global CSS.

  - Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and other common values that need to be reused.
