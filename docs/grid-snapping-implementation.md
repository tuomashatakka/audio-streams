# Grid Snapping Implementation Guide

## Overview âœ¨

We've successfully implemented professional DAW-style grid snapping for audio clips! This feature ensures clips always align to musical divisions (sixteenth notes by default), creating a polished, precise editing experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Smart Grid Snapping**
- **Automatic alignment** to sixteenth note grid positions
- **Musical accuracy** respecting BPM and time signatures
- **Cross-track movement** with proper position preservation
- **Initial placement** snaps to grid when clips are added

### 2. **Enhanced Drag System**
- **Visual feedback** during drag operations
- **Multi-track movement** with automatic track detection
- **Constraint handling** prevents clips from moving outside valid bounds
- **Performance optimized** drag rendering

### 3. **Professional Visual Feedback**
- **Enhanced shadows** and highlighting during drag
- **Clear selection states** with proper visual hierarchy
- **Smooth transitions** with performance-conscious animations

## Technical Implementation

### Core Utilities Added (`audioUtils.ts`)

```typescript
// New grid snapping functions
snapToGrid(time, bpm, gridSize, timeSignature)
snapPixelsToGrid(pixels, pixelsPerSecond, bpm, gridSize)
calculateClipDragResult(startX, startY, currentX, currentY, ...)
getTrackIndexFromY(clientY, trackHeight, trackAreaTop)
```

### Enhanced Clip Component (`Clip.tsx`)

- **Complete rewrite** of drag handling system
- **Grid-aware positioning** with real-time snapping
- **Multi-track drag support** with visual feedback
- **Separation of concerns** between visual feedback and state updates

### Context Integration (`AudioEngineContext.tsx`)

- **Automatic grid snapping** in all clip position updates
- **Initial placement alignment** when clips are first added
- **Cross-track movement** handling with proper state management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Grid Snapping
```typescript
// All clip movements automatically snap to sixteenth note grid
const snappedTime = snapToGrid(rawTime, 120, GridSize.SIXTEENTH, { numerator: 4, denominator: 4 })
```

### Cross-Track Movement
```typescript
// Clips can be dragged between tracks while maintaining grid alignment
onMoveToTrack(clipId, targetTrackId, snappedStartTime)
```

## Configuration Options

### Grid Size Options
- `GridSize.WHOLE` - Whole notes (1 beat Ã— 4)
- `GridSize.HALF` - Half notes (2 beats)
- `GridSize.QUARTER` - Quarter notes (1 beat) 
- `GridSize.EIGHTH` - Eighth notes (1/2 beat)
- `GridSize.SIXTEENTH` - Sixteenth notes (1/4 beat) **[Default]**
- `GridSize.THIRTY_SECOND` - Thirty-second notes (1/8 beat)

### Customization Points
- **BPM awareness** - Grid automatically adjusts to project tempo
- **Time signature support** - Works with any time signature
- **Visual feedback** - Customizable drag states and animations

## Future Enhancements ðŸš€

### Optional Grid Visualization
Consider adding visual grid lines in the timeline area:

```typescript
// Optional: Add to Timeline component
const gridLines = useMemo(() => {
  const lines = []
  const gridDuration = getGridDuration(bpm, GridSize.SIXTEENTH, timeSignature)
  
  for (let time = 0; time <= duration; time += gridDuration) {
    lines.push({
      x: timeToPixels(time, pixelsPerSecond),
      opacity: time % (gridDuration * 4) === 0 ? 0.3 : 0.1 // Major/minor grid
    })
  }
  
  return lines
}, [duration, pixelsPerSecond, bpm, timeSignature])
```

### Grid Size Toggle
Add a UI control for users to change grid resolution:

```typescript
// Optional: Grid size selector
const gridSizes = [
  { label: '1/4', value: GridSize.QUARTER },
  { label: '1/8', value: GridSize.EIGHTH },
  { label: '1/16', value: GridSize.SIXTEENTH },
  { label: '1/32', value: GridSize.THIRTY_SECOND }
]
```

### Snap Toggle
Allow users to temporarily disable snapping:

```typescript
// Optional: Hold Shift to disable snapping
const isSnapDisabled = event.shiftKey
const finalTime = isSnapDisabled ? rawTime : snapToGrid(rawTime, ...)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Transform-based visual feedback** during drag (no DOM reflows)
- **Batched state updates** for position changes
- **Efficient grid calculations** with memoized values
- **Minimal re-renders** through careful prop passing

### Best Practices
- Grid calculations happen only on drag end (not during movement)
- Visual feedback uses CSS transforms for smooth performance
- State updates are batched and optimized for React's reconciliation

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Test Cases
1. **Basic Drag** - Clips should snap to sixteenth note positions
2. **Cross-Track** - Drag clips between tracks maintains position accuracy
3. **Initial Placement** - New clips align to grid when dropped
4. **Boundary Handling** - Clips respect project boundaries and track limits
5. **Selection State** - Visual feedback matches interaction state

### Expected Behaviors
- âœ… Clips snap to musical grid positions
- âœ… Cross-track movement preserves timing accuracy
- âœ… Visual feedback provides clear interaction state
- âœ… Performance remains smooth during complex drag operations
- âœ… Initial clip placement aligns to grid

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for professional audio editing workflows! The grid snapping system ensures musical accuracy while maintaining the responsive, intuitive feel that users expect from modern DAW interfaces â™ª(Â´â–½ï½€)

The modular design makes it easy to extend with additional features like custom grid sizes, snap toggles, or visual grid overlays as your project evolves! ðŸŽµâœ¨
